Analyze the following Arcade flow data chunk and identify all meaningful user interactions.
Focus on the 'capturedEvents' and 'steps' to understand what actions the user took.

For each step:
- Look at the step type (IMAGE, VIDEO, CHAPTER)
- For IMAGE steps: check clickContext (cssSelector, text, elementType) to understand what was clicked
- For VIDEO steps: consider the duration and playback as an action
- For CHAPTER steps: look at the title, subtitle, and paths (buttons/choices)
- Use pageContext (url, title) to provide context about where the action occurred

For capturedEvents:
- Click events with coordinates
- Typing events (user input)
- Scrolling events (navigation)
- Dragging events (interaction)

Extract a list of clear, human-readable descriptions of each interaction.
Each interaction should be a concise sentence describing what the user did.
Include the page context when relevant (e.g., "Clicked 'Add to Cart' on product page").

Examples of good interactions:
- "Clicked on 'Sign In' button at the top navigation"
- "Typed search query in the search bar"
- "Scrolled down the product listing page"
- "Selected 'Standard Shipping' option during checkout"
- "Clicked 'Confirm Purchase' button"
